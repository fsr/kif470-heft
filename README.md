# kif470-heft

Conference brochure for the 47.0th conference of german speaking computer science student associations in Dresden.

## Building the Brochure

To built the brochure you either have to use `LuaLaTeX` or `XeLaTeX` (empirical studies show the first to be faster).
Additionally, the fonts _Montserrat_ and _Raleway_ have to be installed.
